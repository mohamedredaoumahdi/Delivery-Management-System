## 🧪 **TESTING GUIDE**

### **📱 HOW TO TEST THE APP**

**Step 1: Start Backend (if available)**
```bash
# If you have a backend server, start it on port 8000
# The app will try real API calls first, then fallback to mocks
```

**Step 2: Run the Vendor App**
```bash
cd apps/vendor_app
flutter run
# OR restart if already running
```

### **🔐 LOGIN CREDENTIALS FOR TESTING**

**Test Account (Mock Authentication):**
```
Email: vendor@test.com
Password: password
```

**OR Register New Account:**
- Use any email format and password 6+ characters
- All registration data is mocked for development

### **✅ TESTING CHECKLIST**

**Authentication Flow:**
- [ ] Test login with `vendor@test.com` / `password`
- [ ] Test registration with new credentials
- [ ] Test form validation (empty fields, invalid email, short password)
- [ ] Test "Forgot Password" message
- [ ] Verify automatic navigation to dashboard after login

**Dashboard Features:**
- [ ] View today's overview stats (24 orders, $480 revenue, etc.)
- [ ] Check quick action cards (Add Menu Item, View Orders, Analytics, Settings)
- [ ] Scroll through recent orders list
- [ ] Verify all UI elements render properly

**Navigation Testing:**
- [ ] Test bottom navigation between Dashboard, Menu, Orders, Analytics, Profile
- [ ] Test back navigation and app bar functionality
- [ ] Test splash screen animation and auto-navigation

**Menu Management:**
- [ ] View menu items list (3 sample items: Burger, Pizza, Salad)
- [ ] Check menu item details and categories
- [ ] Verify loading states and error handling

**Orders Management:**
- [ ] View orders list (3 sample orders with different statuses)
- [ ] Check order status indicators and customer information
- [ ] Test order item interactions

**Profile Management:**
- [ ] View current user profile information
- [ ] Test profile loading and error states

**Analytics:**
- [ ] View analytics dashboard with mock data
- [ ] Check data visualization and metrics

### **🎨 UI/UX TESTING**

**Theme & Design:**
- [ ] Professional green business theme throughout app
- [ ] Consistent card layouts and spacing
- [ ] Proper icons and visual hierarchy
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes

**Loading States:**
- [ ] All screens show loading indicators during data fetch
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Proper error messages when operations fail

**Form Validation:**
- [ ] Real-time validation on login/register forms
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- [ ] Proper keyboard types (email, phone, etc.)

### **🔧 DEVELOPMENT TESTING**

**API Integration Testing:**
- [ ] App works offline (mock data fallbacks)
- [ ] App tries real API first, falls back gracefully
- [ ] Authentication tokens are stored and managed
- [ ] 401 errors clear tokens and redirect to login

**Performance Testing:**
- [ ] App startup time is reasonable
- [ ] Smooth navigation between screens
- [ ] No memory leaks or crashes during extended use
- [ ] Proper state management with BLoC pattern
