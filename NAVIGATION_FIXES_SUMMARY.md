# Navigation Issues Fixed

## âœ… **Issues Resolved**

### **1. Navigation Stack Problem**
**Issue**: When navigating Home â†’ Shop â†’ Product â†’ Shop â†’ Product â†’ Shop... and pressing back, user had to go through each page one by one instead of going directly back to home.

**Root Cause**: Using `context.push()` which adds each page to the navigation stack instead of replacing the current route.

**Fix**: Changed specific navigation calls from `context.push()` to `context.go()` to replace routes instead of stacking them:

- **Product Details â†’ Shop**: `apps/user_app/lib/features/shop/presentation/pages/product_details_page.dart`
  - Changed shop name navigation from `context.push('/shops/${widget.shopId})` to `context.go('/shops/${widget.shopId})`

- **Search Results â†’ Shop**: `apps/user_app/lib/features/search/presentation/pages/search_page.dart`
  - Changed shop navigation from `context.push('/shops/${shop.id})` to `context.go('/shops/${shop.id})`
  - Changed category navigation from `context.push('/shops?category=...')` to `context.go('/shops?category=...')`
  - Changed "Browse All Shops" from `context.push('/shops')` to `context.go('/shops')`

- **Home â†’ Search**: `apps/user_app/lib/features/home/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`
  - Changed search bar navigation from `context.push('/search')` to `context.go('/search')`

**Result**: Now when users navigate between shops and products, pressing back will take them directly to the previous logical screen instead of going through each intermediate navigation.

### **2. Missing Search Route**
**Issue**: Clicking on the search bar on the home page resulted in `GoException: no routes for location: /search`

**Root Cause**: The `/search` route was not defined in the router configuration.

**Fix**: 
1. **Created Search Page**: `apps/user_app/lib/features/search/presentation/pages/search_page.dart`
   - Full-featured search page with search input, suggestions, and results
   - Integrates with existing `ShopListBloc` for search functionality
   - Includes popular search suggestions and category browsing
   - Handles empty results and error states

2. **Added Search Route**: `apps/user_app/lib/config/routes.dart`
   - Added standalone `/search` route outside the shell route
   - Supports query parameters for initial search terms
   - Route: `GoRoute(path: '/search', builder: (context, state) => SearchPage(...))`

**Result**: Users can now click on the search bar and access a fully functional search page.

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **Navigation Strategy**
- **`context.push()`**: Adds new route to stack - use for modal/detail views that should allow back navigation
- **`context.go()`**: Replaces current route - use for lateral navigation between main sections
- **`context.pop()`**: Removes current route from stack - use for closing modals/details

### **Search Page Features**
- Real-time search as user types (with debouncing)
- Popular search suggestions
- Category-based browsing
- Empty state handling
- Error state handling
- Integration with existing `ShopListBloc`

### **Route Structure**
```
/search (standalone)
/ (shell route with bottom nav)
â”œâ”€â”€ /shops
â”œâ”€â”€ /shops/:id
â”œâ”€â”€ /shops/:id/products/:productId
/cart (shell route)
â”œâ”€â”€ /cart/checkout
/orders (shell route)
â”œâ”€â”€ /orders/:id
â”œâ”€â”€ /orders/:id/tracking
/profile (shell route)
â”œâ”€â”€ /profile/edit
â”œâ”€â”€ /profile/change-password
```

## âœ… **Testing Recommendations**

1. **Navigation Stack Test**:
   - Navigate: Home â†’ Shop â†’ Product â†’ Shop Name â†’ Product â†’ Shop Name
   - Press back button multiple times
   - Should go: Shop â†’ Product â†’ Shop â†’ Home (not through each intermediate step)

2. **Search Functionality Test**:
   - Click search bar on home page
   - Should open search page without errors
   - Type search terms and verify results
   - Click on search suggestions and categories

3. **Bottom Navigation Test**:
   - Ensure bottom navigation updates correctly when using `context.go()`
   - Verify search page doesn't show bottom navigation (standalone route)

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience Improvements**

- **Faster Navigation**: Users can navigate back to main sections quickly
- **Intuitive Search**: Search functionality is now accessible and fully featured
- **Consistent Behavior**: Navigation behaves predictably across the app
- **Reduced Friction**: No more getting stuck in deep navigation stacks
